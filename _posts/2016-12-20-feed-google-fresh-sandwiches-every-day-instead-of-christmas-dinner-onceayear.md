Why do search professionals scatter like roaches when the kitchen light comes on?  Why is everyone acting so sneaky all the time? Why do SEO professionals skulk around dark alleyways, offering their search engine services in furtive, hurried whispers?  What’s up with that?

Don’t we all know that [Google Search](http://www.google.com "Google") is a [somniloquist](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/somniloquist)!  Whenever he is able to catch some shut-eye, a nanosecond at a time, he cries out in his slumber, “feed me . . . feed me Seymour.”

Not only is Google a Glutton, but he’s always hungry — and a picky eater, too.  In a perfect world, all of Google’s food would be steamy hot, bold with spices and [herbs](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/tip/chopping-herbs.html "Chopping Herbs"), and nutritionally rich.

If you and I don’t constantly develop ways to provide Google with all the taste-sensations, fresh out of the pan, out of the oven, and then beautifully-plated, then Google’ll definitely reheat leftovers — hell, he’ll fish out the meals ready to eat ([MREs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal%2C_Ready-to-Eat "Meal, Ready-to-Eat")).

But, honestly, Google would always prefer to eat healthy. Quality over quantity. Google would love to get enough fiber, enough vitamins and minerals, enough healthy fat and presentation.

The internet _webosphere_ is like greater [Washington, DC](http://www.dc.gov "Washington, D.C.") on a weekday lunchtime: food trucks everywhere! Yes, also restaurants, fast food, fast-casual, brown bags of tuna prepared at home, hot dog and burrito carts, office cantinas, take out places, and by-the-pound buffet joints.

Before the age of the food truck, there were some carts offering haute cuisine, but it wasn’t until the rise of the food truck when the entire power structure lunch at least, was set: dirty water dogs, burgers, buffet salad, or sit down restaurant food.

The [barrier to entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry "Barriers to entry") was pretty impossible save for a few rich folks doing it for vanity or experienced folks doing it for shareholder value. And the paperwork, licensing, and all the other food-hoops required.

But DC is big, hungry, and wants all the taste-sensations, fresh out of the pan, out of the oven, and then beautifully-plated; and we want our lunch to be delicious, steamy hot, bold with spices and herbs, and nutritionally rich.

Because DC’s already hungry, DC’s only somewhat a snob!  The majority of folks who work in DC during the work week is balancing between time, price, proximity, healthiness, preference, and deliciousness. And all you need to do is discover what as many of those things are and cook to order.

You can feed Google. You can even become Google’s favorite type of food, snack, lunch, sandwich, dessert, cheat, breakfast, dinner, late-night bite. But you, like every great cook, every great chef, cannot just make something awesome once.

You don’t need to make the [Guinness Book of World Records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records "Guinness World Records") and then done.  SEO is not one-and-done! It’s feeding the newsroom rather than just getting a novel out of you just to have written a novel.

I’m a pretty good cook. In fact, I have made some amazing things perfectly actually once (remember that _[Bûche de Noël](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_log_%28cake%29 "Yule log (cake)")_ I made that **one time** with the powdered sugar snow, the branches, the ganache and cake?).

But Google prefers hot fresh donuts over even my _Bûche de Noël _once it’s a week old.

So, stop sneaking around and stop trying to be way fancier than you’re able to provide every single day.

Google wants your content food as hungrily as it wants the the President’s latest transcript or the top headlines from the [New York Times](http://www.newyorktimes.com "New York Times").  But only if it’s at least as fresh, nutritional, and as tasty as the other good stuff around it.

I sell [web site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website") and branding services for my buddy [Mike McDermott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemcdermott) of [Bash Foo](https://bashfoo.com/) and the vast majority of all your competitors can’t cook at all; and those who can, only cook a couple times a year at the most, give or take a couple years.

While the bar is super-low for 99% of your competitors, the bar is nosebleed-high for the remaining 1% who have all that sorted out. Also, since the webinternetosphere is a global market, mostly, that 1% is still a very large number.

Google doesn’t think so. Google thinks that it really sucks that only 1% of all online content-providers offer more than complete crap. Those 1% (who are generally the same people who are in the 1% in the real world), the best-of-breed in Google Search, are the same people that Google, in it’s love of the little guy and it’s passion for egalitarianism and equal access based on an impossibly-low barrier to entry, fights hard to disempower.

Google wants diversity — your diversity — but Google also knows that the people who search using Google are also impatient, intolerant to junk results, unwilling to suffer ugly, unable to trust a site that is rarely if every updated, unsure about sites that haven’t kept up with technology and design (so many of our websites are the equivalent of shag carpet, orange appliances, avocado green counter tops, old stove, and a tiny ancient fridge with no stainless or granite or backsplash to be seen _anywhere_!

Come up with a content marketing plan that is the equivalent of my simple peasant meal of eggs, chicken, greens, fish, herbs, and spice, and then run with it. Make it every day. Just make sure it’s fresh, it’s honest, it’s make with the best ingredients possible, and you don’t cut corners. Put too much gravy or cream or béarnaise on your dish and maybe that’s an attempt to hide a bunch of flaws.  Gilding the lily is almost always a way to give an often deceptively attractive or improved appearance.

Cook simply, show your work, make it basic, use good ingredients, plate it lovingly, deliver it quickly (you all need faster sites), and you’ll become Google’s favorite — at least when it comes to the particular fare you’re offering, within your niche.

Now, your turn. It’s essential to think of Google as hungry and in need of what you — or anybody — have to contribute (Google’s like Wikipedia that way, but unlike Wikipedia, you’re allowed — encouraged – to create your own page!)

So, that box you gladly checked when you finished your website three years ago isn’t a completed task. How dare you!  It was just the very first version of a constantly expanding, growing, changing, and living collection of documents.

OK, after all of this talk about food, I’m ready to eat — ready, set, **Publish**!
