title: chocolate caramel crunch almonds  new kitchen favorites

description: Mostly because I have little interest in telling you how to part with your hard-earned money, this isn’t a gift guide. However, ahem, I do purchase a few kitchen-related items each year and thought I’d mention some of the standouts from 2016\. [, all still in heavy rotation.] Most are remarkably basic, either because I had necessities to replace (cough) but a lot are simple just because I’m incredibly stubborn and it really has taken me this long to buy a second set of measuring cups and spoons, some aprons and a coffee-making apparatus. Not all of these may pack up well in boxes with ribbon — well, except that  at the end, of course — but I can promise you that they’re getting a lot of mileage in a heavy-use kitchen, and as always, I bought them myself.

Not all of these may pack up well in boxes with ribbon — well, except that [deliciousness](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/31293569372/in/dateposted/) at the end, of course — but I can promise you that they’re getting a lot of mileage in a heavy-use kitchen, and as always, I bought them myself.
