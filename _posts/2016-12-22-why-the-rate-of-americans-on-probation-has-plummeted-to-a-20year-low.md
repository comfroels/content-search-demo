Probation is the most expansive component of the U.S. correctional system, overseeing more criminal offenders than all jails and prisons combined. During the height of the U.S. crime wave, from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, the number of probationers grew by thousands every month, many of whom eventually ended up serving prison terms for more serious crimes. It can therefore only be good news that a [Bureau of Justice Statistics report](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5784) released yesterday shows that the rate of Americans being on probation is at a more than 20-year low.

The number of probationers dropped by 78,700 in 2015 — about 2 percent — which is roughly equivalent to the population of Gary, Ind. This latest annual decline continues a trend that began almost a decade ago and has brought the rate of probation supervision down to 1,522 per 100,000 adults, its lowest point since early 1994.

Three factors likely contributed to this generational low in the proportion of Americans who are on probation.

First, the crime rate has [plummeted in recent decades](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/latest-crime-statistics-released), which obviously translates into fewer people becoming involved in the correctional system. Second, innovative probation models using “swift, certain and fair” behavior-change strategies have promoted rehabilitation and [helped more offenders successfully exit the criminal justice system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/19/the-interesting-thing-that-happened-when-washington-state-tried-an-18th-century-version-of-justice/?utm_term=.4d06debf19c1). Third, declining caseloads allow probation departments to devote more resources to each offender, creating a virtuous cycle in which successful probation feeds further success throughout the community supervision system.
